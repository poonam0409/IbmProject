<title>IBM InfoSphere Information Server Rapid Modeler and Rapid Generator for SAP Applications</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Installation and Prerequisites</h2>
The
<em>IBM InfoSphere Information Server Packs for SAP Applications</em>
consist of two components (see also <a href="overview.html#componentoverview">here</a>):
<ol>
    <li>Client: <br />
    The client is an extension of the InfoSphere Data Architect and is
    installed with its own launchpad using IBM Installation Manager.</li>
    <li>Server:<br />
    For the Rapid Generator it is required to install a server component
    that performs the actual job generation. This server component is an
    enterprise application (provided as an .EAR file) that is installed on
    the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) of IBM Information Server. The
    .EAR file can be installed with standard WAS means, e.g., through the
    administrative console using a web browser.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Client install</h3>
The client install installs the Rapid Modeler as well as the Rapid
Generator client.
<ol>
    <li>Copy the installation package to the machine where IBM
    InfoSphere Data Architect is installed.</li>
    <li>Run the command <b>launchpad.exe</b> of the installation package</li>
    <li>Click through the wizard and make sure that you use the same package group where
    you installed InfoSphere Data Architect for the installation.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Server component install</h3>
The server component install is only required for Rapid Generator.
<br />There are a couple of ways to install the enterprise applications
in WebSphere Application Server. One is through the administrative
console using a web browser:
<ol>
    <li>Find out the port of the administrative console. Typically,
    the following works: Open the Information Server Web Console and take a
    look at the URL it points to. If this number is 9080 (default port) the
    administrative console typically runs on port 9060. If it is 9081, the admin
    console runs on 9061 and so on.</li>
    <li>Point your web browser to
    http://&lt;InformationServerDomainHost&gt;:9060/ibm/console.</li>
    <li>Login using the Application Server administrator credentials.</li>
    <li>Open the <em>Enterprise Applications</em> menu on the left.</li>
    <li>Click on <em>Install</em></li>
    <li>Click on <em>Browse</em> and select the <b>com.ibm.is.sappack.gen.server.ear</b> file of
    the installation package</li>
    <li>Walk through the wizard leaving all default settings</li>
    <li>After the installation is installed save the master
    configuration.</li>
    <li>In the <em>Enterprise Applications</em> view browse to the
    application. It should have a red cross next to it as a sign that the
    application is not yet started.</li>
    <li>Check the checkbox next to the application and click on <em>Start</em>.
    A green arrow should now appear next to the application.</li>
</ol>
