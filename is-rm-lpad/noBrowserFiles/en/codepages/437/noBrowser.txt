An error occurred while starting the launchpad.  This error typically occurs when the launchpad
is unable to find a supported browser.  Check your product's documentation for a list of supported
browsers. 

NOTE: This file is a place holder for product specific instructions
      about how to recover from this error.

You should describe the location of installation programs on the product CD
so the user can run them directly without starting launchpad if necessary.

Procedure for correcting the error that is preventing the launchpad from displaying
===================================================================================

The launchpad supports the following browsers:
   o   Mozilla
   o   Firefox
   o   Internet Explorer (Microsoft Windows platforms only)
   o   SeaMonkey
Please refer to the product Release Notes for supported browser versions.

Use the following procedure to attempt to correct the error that is preventing
the launchpad from displaying and to try to start the launchpad again:

1. If you do not have the Mozilla Web browser, download and install the Mozilla 
Web browser from http://www.mozilla.org. 

    On Linux and UNIX platforms, export the location of the supported browser. 
    For example:   

    export BROWSER=/usr/bin/mozilla


2. If the product CD is no longer accessible, insert the CD into a CD drive. 

    Mount the drive if necessary on Linux and UNIX platforms.


3. Restart the launchpad by issuing the following command: 

	Linux and UNIX platforms:      ./launchpad.sh
	Windows platforms:             launchpad.exe
