  <h2>Cheat sheets</h2>
A couple of cheat sheets are available that basically contain the same information as the movies above. 
To open them go to <b>Help -> Cheat Sheets -> InfoSphere Pack for SAP</b>. 
There are two subcategories:
<ol>
<li><b>End-to-end</b>: Compound cheat sheets that describe all steps for larger tasks like "Importing metadata". Use these cheat sheets to get started.</li>
<li><b>Tasks</b>: Short cheat sheets describing smaller tasks. These cheat sheets are sub-steps of the end-to-end cheat sheets. 
Use them as a reference.</li>
</ol>
Select a specific cheat sheet and
click OK.

  <h2>Example files</h2>
Example files for all required artifacts are available through an example wizard.
Go to <b>File -> New -> Example -> InfoSphere Pack for SAP -> Example files for ABAP Table Lists, IDoc Segment Lists, 
Rapid Modeler, and Rapid Generator configurations</b>.
The wizard lets you select a Data Design project where the files are copied to.


<h2>InfoCenter help</h2>
To open the Info center help go to <b>Help -> Help Contents</b>. In the window that opens look for the top level category
<b>InfoSphere for SAP</b>.
