<h1>What's new in this version?</h1>
This section describes the new features / important changes for the current drop.
<br/><br/>

The RM/RG in this version contains significant changes regarding the was how metadata is imported and jobs are generated.
The main objective of these changes is to move most of the options required for metadata import and job generation out of the 
respective wizards but make them reside in files that exist in the IDA workspace. The advantages of this approach are:
<ul>
<li>Re-usability: You can
have multiple settings files for different scenarios and you can share them (either with regular file export / import) or
through version control. This means that you don't have to rely solely on documentation for communicating
common settings for your project. Instead you can share the configurations directly.</li>
<li>Speed: the wizards require only the settings files and no longer require you to type / modify the options
every time you start an import or job generation.</li>
<li>(Troubleshooting: In case something goes wrong it is much easier to deliver a test case for reproducing issues, 
just send those files.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enhanced connection management</h2>
Connections to SAP systems and Information Server instances can be managed through a specialized view.
You can define SAP connections per workspace (just as in previous versions) or once you have defined
a connection to an Information Server, use the connections defined there (e.g. through the DataStage Administrator for SAP).
In a typical Conversion Workbench scenario, you typically don't need local connections anymore because
you will always use the SAP connections from Information Server.

<h2>New workspace objects</h2>

The following new objects (i.e. files in the IDA workspace) can be created to hold certain information required for Rapid Modeler
and Rapid Generator.

<h3>Rapid Modeler</h3>

<h4>SAP Object lists</h4>

An SAP Object list describes <em>what</em> is imported into a logical data model.
It simply contains a list of SAP objects. There are two possible instantiations:

<ol>
<li>ABAP Table List: a list of SAP logical tables, e.g. KNA1, KNVV, KNB1</li>
<li>IDoc Segment List: an IDoc type and a list of segment types for 
this IDoc type, e.g. DEBMAS06 and segment E1KNA1M, E1KNB1M.</li>
</ol>

In previous versions, the metadata import wizard had pages where you could select table or IDoc names directly
from SAP or from a comma separated list. Think of an ABAP Table List / IDoc Segment List as those pages, only in a tabbed editor. 

<h4>Rapid Modeler configuration</h4>

A Rapid Modeler configuration describes <em>how</em> metadata is imported into a logical data model. 
It contains settings that define, e.g., how SAP data types are mapped to IDA types, if check tables should 
also be imported or not, if / how keys are created, which technical fields are created, or into which package
the objects are imported.
<br/>
In previous versions, the metadata import wizard contained separate pages for these kinds of options.
Think of a Rapid Modeler configuration as those pages, only in a tabbed editor.


<h3>Rapid Generator</h3>

<h4>Rapid Generator configuration</h4>
A Rapid Generator configuration captures all settings that are needed for job generation. It includes separate pages
to configure, e.g., SAP credentials, ODBC settings, settings for ABAP extract jobs, or transcoding settings.
It also allows you to use parameters (or parameter sets) for each of those values.

<br/>
Think of a Rapid Generator configuration as those pages, only in a tabbed editor.

<br/><br/>
The actual import / job generation tasks are still be triggered through wizards but instead having pages 
for all different options you will just have to point the wizard to the file(s) in the workspace containing
the ABAP Table List or IDoc Segment List, the Rapid Modeler configuration, or the Rapid Generator configuration, respectively. 
       
<h2>Preview features</h2>
This section describes features that are contained in this drop but which are not yet officially supported but we
would love to get feedback from you.

<h3>SAP Packs Navigator</h3>
This new view displays the IDA workspace in a way that it introduces new categories of objects that are relevant
when working with Rapid Modeler / Rapid Generator. The top level nodes of the navigator are Data Design projects 
(just as in the Data Project Explorer). Below the project, there are the following categories:
<ul>
<li>ABAP Table List</li>
<li>IDoc Segment List</li>
<li>Rapid Modeler Configurations</li>
<li>Logical data models</li>
<li>Physical data models</li>
<li>Rapid Generator Configurations</li>
<li>ABAP Program archives</li>
</ul> 
Under each category you can see the objects described by the category. 

<h3>SAP Import history view</h3>
This new IDA view displays the graphically the previous imports of metadata into logical models.   
For instance, it enables you to see for a given ABAP Table list where it was used to import metadata.
This information is represented in a tree where the focus is always set on the tree root.
In the upper right corner you see two buttons "Up" and "Down" which define the dependency direction.
<br/>
To show dependencies for an object available in the Data Project Explorer or SAP Packs Navigator, simply right click 
on it and select InfoSphere Pack for SAP -> Show in SAP Import History View.
