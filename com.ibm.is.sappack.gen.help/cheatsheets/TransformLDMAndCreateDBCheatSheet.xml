<cheatsheet title="Preparing a logical data model for job generation">
   <intro>
      <description>
         This cheat sheet shows you how to transform a logical data model into a physical data model
         to be used for the Rapid Generator for SAP.
         It will also show how a DB can be created from this physical model.

         <b>NOTE: Be sure to enter the names of projects, models, etc. in the following steps exactly as
         indicated otherwise the "Click to perform" buttons might not work.

      <description>
         Identify a DB2 database somewhere in your system landscape that you want to use to hold
         SAP data.
         <br/> 
         You will have to create an ODBC connection on your DataStage server machine to this
         database.
         How to create an ODBC connection depends on the operating system. Please consult your system 
         administrator.
