      <intro>
         This cheat sheet will guide you end-to-end through the process of 
         importing logical tables from SAP into a logical data model,
         transform the logical data model into a physical data model, creating a database from the physical model, 
         and, finally, generating a DataStage job that will extract the SAP table to the created database.
      </intro>
      <onCompletion>
         You have now created a logical data model containing SAP metadata, a database that
         can hold SAP data, and jobs that are able to extract data from SAP to this database.

            This task will guide you through preparing the logical data model created previously
            for Rapid Generator for SAP. This will involve transforming it into a physical data model and 
            create the database of the physical model.
