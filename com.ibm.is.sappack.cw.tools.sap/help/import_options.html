<h1>Relations</h1>
Specify whether you also want to import primary- foreign key relations
between tables.
<h1>Check and text-tables</h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>"Import metadata for related check-tables":</b> Select this
	option if you want the wizard to also import check tables that are
	related to your business tables. (e.g. if your business table has a
	field containing a country code, the wizard will also extract metadata
	of the telated check table that does the mapping between country code
	and the country's name). Generally a check table contains enumerated
	values that are referenced to by business tables (like "gender",
	"courtesy title", etc...), however there are also tables that hold
	business data and are referenced to as check tables at the same time
	(e.g. "customers")</li>
	<li><b>"Import metadata for related text tables":</b> This option
	is only available if you select the <b>"Import metadata for related
	check-tables"</b> option. Text tables are tables that contain the
	denotation of entities stored in a check table in different languages.
	(e.g. if the check table stores the country code and the name of a
	country, the related text table will contain the name of the country
	translated to different languages)</li>
</ul>
