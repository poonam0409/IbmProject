<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">As part of almost any SAP project, you must identify, analyze, and document the data model of SAP. The data models are almost always customized and augmented, and the custom data models differ from the standard models. Extracting data from and loading data into an SAP system requires knowledge of the external applications and the SAP interfaces. In enterprises, different teams are responsible for data integration and the SAP system. This division of responsibility leads to improvised integrations, for example, on the exchange of flat files.</p>
<p class="p">When you integrate external applications with an SAP system, two challenges arise: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Where is the data that is relevant for the task in the SAP system? What data structures in SAP store which information?</li>
<li class="li">How do I extract and load this data to and from my external application? Which extraction or loading mechanisms are available and how do I use them?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The challenges are not independent. For example, SAP IDocs define both a data structure and a transport mechanism. A transport mechanism is not the same as the mechanisms that are typically used to extract SAP logical tables. The following tools address the issues:</p>
<dl class="dl"><dt class="dt dlterm"><span class="ph">InfoSphere™</span> Rapid Modeler for SAP Applications</dt>
<dd class="dd">You can use this tool to browse the SAP data model and import all the tables that are related through foreign key relationships that is created by using  <span class="ph">IBM InfoSphere Data Architect</span>. You can create diagrams from the tables that you import, and add comments and annotations to better understand the metadata.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">InfoSphere Rapid Generator for SAP Applications</dt>
<dd class="dd">You can use this tool to generate <span class="ph">InfoSphere DataStage®</span> jobs with the SAP metadata that was imported by using <span class="ph">InfoSphere</span> Rapid Modeler for SAP applications. These <span class="ph">InfoSphere DataStage</span> jobs extract or load the actual data of the SAP objects described by the metadata that was imported to or from a relational database or flat files.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="p">You can move data from various source systems such as, flat files, relational databases, or other SAP systems, into a single, consolidated SAP system. During this process, you build an intermediate database which is sometimes called as the <dfn class="term">staging area</dfn>. You can use this database to store all data to be loaded into the target system. In addition, complex normalization and cleansing operations are performed here. You can use the <span class="ph">InfoSphere</span> Rapid Modeler and the InfoSphere Rapid Generator for SAP to: <ul class="ul"><li class="li">Create the schema of the staging area for the SAP target system.</li>
<li class="li">Generate jobs that load the target SAP system from the staging area.</li>
<li class="li">Create a schema and generate extract jobs for SAP source systems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Both the <span class="ph">InfoSphere</span> Rapid Modeler for SAP Applications tool and the InfoSphere Rapid Generator for SAP Applications tool have clients that are implemented as extensions (Eclipse plugins) to <span class="ph">InfoSphere Data
Architect</span>. Both tools also rely on the SAP JCo library, which provides connectivity to an SAP system.  InfoSphere Rapid Generator for SAP Applications requires InfoSphere Information Server to generate and compile the <span class="ph">InfoSphere DataStage</span>jobs. An enterprise application is deployed as a <span class="ph filepath">.ear</span> file in the same instance of WebSpehere Application Server that InfoSphere Information Server uses.</p>
