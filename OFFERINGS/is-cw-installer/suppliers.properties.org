# The next dependencies are simpler, but also sensitive - especially the order.  For example, it appears that
# src.IES must be first as this is what the target Eclipse is built from when running JUnit tests.
# Also, src.DTP16x must come early in the list to ensure its plugins are picked before the constellation ones.
